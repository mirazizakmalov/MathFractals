The script requires numpy and matplotlib module installed in your editor. without it it won't work.

the script is only tested on visual studio code, if might throw an error related to figure position if the script is run on another editor. 

enjoy!

----------------------------------

make sure main.py and myfunctions.py are in the same folder when you run the script.
run main.py to visualize the animation.
